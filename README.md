    TypeScript type definitions for React Lua.

    <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react"><strong>npm package ‚Üí</strong></a>
  </p>
</p>

TypeScript type definitions for [React Lua](https://github.com/jsdotlua/react-lua) and [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com), sourced from the official React types. Currently, only [`@rbxts/react`](https://npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react) and
[`@rbxts/react-roblox`](https://npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react-roblox) are available.

If we're missing any deviations from [React Lua](https://jsdotlua.github.io/react-lua/), please [open an issue or pull request](https://github.com/littensy/rbxts-react/issues/new) to let us know!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package uses unreleased roblox-ts features, and requires `roblox-ts@next` to be installed.
> If you're encountering issues with `@rbxts/react`, please see the [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) section for more information.

## üì¶ Setup

### Installation

Get started by adding React and ReactRoblox to your project:

```sh
npm install @rbxts/react @rbxts/react-roblox
yarn add @rbxts/react @rbxts/react-roblox
pnpm add @rbxts/react @rbxts/react-roblox # üî¥ See below
```

`roblox-ts` must also be installed with the `next` tag:

```sh
npm install -D roblox-ts@next
yarn add -D roblox-ts@next
pnpm add -D roblox-ts@next
```

### Configuration

Set up your `tsconfig.json` to use the React JSX factory.

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "jsxFactory": "React.createElement",
  "jsxFragmentFactory": "React.Fragment"
}
```

### Usage with PNPM

If you're using PNPM as your package manager, you'll need to create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```ini
node-linker=hoisted
```

## üöÄ Examples

### Mounting your app

```tsx
import React, { StrictMode } from "@rbxts/react";
import { createPortal, createRoot } from "@rbxts/react-roblox";

const root = createRoot(new Instance("Folder"));

root.render(<StrictMode>{createPortal(<App />, playerGui)}</StrictMode>);
```

### Function Component

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "@rbxts/react";

interface CounterProps {
	initialCount: number;
}

export function Counter({ initialCount }: CounterProps) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

	return (
		<textbutton
			Text={`Count: ${count}`}
			AnchorPoint={new Vector2(0.5, 0.5)}
			Size={new UDim2(0, 100, 0, 50)}
			Position={new UDim2(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)}
			Event={{
				Activated: () => setCount(count + 1),
			}}
		/>
	);
}
```

### Class Component

```tsx
import React, { Component, ReactComponent } from "@rbxts/react";

interface CounterProps {
	initialCount: number;
}

interface CounterState {
	count: number;
}

@ReactComponent
export class Counter extends Component<CounterProps, CounterState> {
	state: CounterState = {
		count: this.props.initialCount,
	};

	render() {
		return (
			<textbutton
				Text={`Count: ${this.state.count}`}
				AnchorPoint={new Vector2(0.5, 0.5)}
				Size={new UDim2(0, 100, 0, 50)}
				Position={new UDim2(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)}
				Event={{
					Activated: () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }),
				}}
			/>
		);
	}
}
```

### Error Boundary

```tsx
import React, { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactComponent } from "@rbxts/react";

interface ErrorBoundaryProps {
	fallback: (error: unknown) => React.Element;
}

interface ErrorBoundaryState {
	hasError: boolean;
	message?: unknown;
}

@ReactComponent
export class ErrorBoundary extends Component<ErrorBoundaryProps, ErrorBoundaryState> {
	state: ErrorBoundaryState = {
		hasError: false,
	};

	componentDidCatch(message: unknown, info: ErrorInfo) {
		warn(message, info.componentStack);

		this.setState({
			hasError: true,
			message: `${message} ${info.componentStack}`,
		});
	}

	render() {
		if (this.state.hasError) {
			return this.props.fallback(this.state.message);
		} else {
			return this.props.children;
		}
	}
}
```

## üîé Troubleshooting

### compilerOptions.jsxFactory must be `Roact.createElement`!

If you encounter this error during compilation, it means that you're using an older version of `roblox-ts`. Make sure to install `roblox-ts@next` and uninstall any global installations of `roblox-ts`:

```sh
npm uninstall -g roblox-ts
npm install -D roblox-ts@next
```

### `(X)` cannot be used as a JSX component. Its return type `Element` is not a valid JSX element.

This error occurs when a conflicting installation of react-ts is present in your project. This can be for one of two reasons:

1. You have react-ts installed in your dependencies. (`npm uninstall @rbxts/roact`)
2. You have an outdated package installed that depends on react-ts.

The most common cause is an outdated package. To view the packages that depend on `@rbxts/react-ts` (which will be under the alias `@rbxts/roact`), run the following command:

```sh
npm ls @rbxts/roact
```

If you find any packages that depend on `@rbxts/react-ts`, you should update them to the latest version, or open an issue on their repository to request an update.

### Attempt to index nil with `useMemo` (or other hooks)

This error happens when React can't figure out how to retrieve the current instance of the component. This can be for a number of reasons:

1. You're using a hook outside of a component, or using function components incorrectly.

Hooks must be used inside the body of a function component. A common mistake is to call hooks conditionally, or inside a callback function. Make sure you're calling hooks at the top level of your function component.

**Do not call a function component directly.** To render a function component, wrap it in a JSX tag:

```tsx
<App />; // üü¢ Good
App(); // üî¥ Bad
```

2. There's more than one version of React in your project.

When multiple versions of React are present in your node_modules, any packages that depend on React might try to use the wrong one.

Make sure your `rbxts_include.node_module.@rbxts` folder in Roblox Studio doesn't contain a module named "React" (capital R). This module is a sign Rojo has not fully removed react-ts. If so, you should delete your `node_modules` folder and restart Rojo.

If a fresh install doesn't fix the issue, you might have a package installed that depends on react-ts. See [the previous section](#x-cannot-be-used-as-a-jsx-component-its-return-type-element-is-not-a-valid-jsx-element) for more information.
